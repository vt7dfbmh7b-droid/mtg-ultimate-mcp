# Ultimate MTG — Project Handoff

This is the short compatibility handoff. **`project-state.json` is the authoritative current-state source.**

## Resume in under five minutes

1. Read `project-state.json` and `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`.
2. Read `validation-index.json` and `docs/VALIDATION-STATE.md` to identify current versus stale registered evidence.
3. Inspect live head of `agent/v15-native-deck-intelligence` and PR #29.
4. Read `ULTIMATE_MTG_SPEC.md`, then only the decision/failure/validation docs relevant to the active milestone.
5. Continue from the Next actions below. Do not reconstruct old chats unless state integrity fails.

## Current mode

- Active milestone: **INTEL-02 — Actual autonomous deck improvement**
- Intelligence development paused: **no**
- Experimental branch: `agent/v15-native-deck-intelligence`
- Development checkpoint at pause: `77a5383fa7490aa91360b8186a4bda890f632157`
- Active branch validation: **accepted-checkpoint-77a-audit-cleanup-07f36-manual-review-blocked**

## Stable safety boundary

Stable remains **V0.13 / 0.13.0** on `main`. No merge, stable/current promotion, version bump or release is authorized by this handoff.

## Latest fully validated executable experimental baseline

`63bb7274004060eea507f7991a04b84921d0cd47` on `agent/package-probabilities`.

Latest fully validated executable experimental baseline documented by the prior authoritative handoff. Later V0.15 deck-intelligence work on PR #29 remains experimental until milestone controls complete.

## Important pending validation

The last persisted Marvel control is `07f36a74529a717cf6c6e85f00ea999f40dff098` with outcome **focused-pass-broad-fail**. At follow-up source 07f36a7..., focused Marvel refinement passed mechanically with five swaps and removed only the curve failure. Manual review does not yet accept those swaps: several spend tutor, interaction, cost-reduction or graveyard-utility roles for generic gains. Broad Marvel executed successfully but accepted no package: its exhaustive restricted pool exposed exactly two fast-mana and two tutor matches, all already present or excluded. Broad target-quality and strategy-preservation therefore remain blocking.

## Next actions

1. Implement generic semantic protection so non-surplus tutors, spot interaction, cost-reduction infrastructure and graveyard utility are not cut for cosmetic role gains; then rerun focused and broad Marvel from one exact source.
2. Keep the five focused-Marvel swaps unaccepted until the generic protection rule is proven; then manually audit Necron Dynasties, Squirreled Away and Food and Fellowship for the same engine-preservation standard.
3. If any control or manual audit fails, fix the generic semantic/selection rule rather than adding name-specific exceptions, then rerun the whole affected family from one exact executable source.
4. When the full INTEL-02 family is mechanically green and manually acceptable, update project-state.json and validation-index.json together and record that exact executable SHA as the new accepted development checkpoint.
5. Then run an eligible verified full-table win-package scenario to close the main INTEL-01 proof gap.
6. Only after the consolidated checkpoint and positive INTEL-01 proof should BENCH-01 broaden to materially different cases such as FF-only Counter Blitz and the NZ$500 Liliana, Heretical Healer challenge.
7. Keep PR #29 as experimental/evidence history. Do not merge or promote it automatically; when V0.15 is genuinely accepted, prepare a clean promotion candidate rather than treating the current 1,000+ commit evidence branch as release-ready.
